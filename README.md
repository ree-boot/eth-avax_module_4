# Avalanche_module_4
This Solidity program is a simple contract that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language and the working of smart contracts in a blockchain. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for a future Web3 and blockchain Journey.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the fuji blockchain. The contract has simple functionality that demonstrates the creation and use of custom tokens in Solidity and its deployment on the testnet fuji chain. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
You can refer to creation and deployment of contract on Fuji testnet through:
https://docs.avascan.info/tutorial/deploy-and-verify-an-erc-20-token

Get testing AVAX from: https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c
(join their official discord and request there in order to get coupon code: https://discord.gg/Zm4T88Ja)

Connect you account to the fuji testnet snowtrace: https://43113.testnet.snowtrace.io/

If you want to operate the contract with Remix after deploying it on testnet with above method:
1: Create a same contract on remix and compile it.
2: Go to DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS(on left hand panel).
3: Go to the Environment(which is the first option of DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS) and change it to injected provider, then connect to your metamask wallet.
4: Go to At Address button under contracts heading and paste your contract address(which you got from hardhat deployment) there.
5: You will see the contract deployed there, copy its address and paste it on snowtrace(https://43113.testnet.snowtrace.io/).
